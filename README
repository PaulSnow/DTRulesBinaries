For CHIP

These are the Binaries for the CHIP example.  Download all of them as a Zip or tar from GitHub.  Unpack them into a directory.  Then do the following:

To compile the decision tables, execute:

	java -jar CompileCHIP.jar

Then to generate some test cases (say 100 test cases), execute:

	java -jar GenTestCasesCHIP.jar 100

Then to execute the rules against the given test cases using 4 threads, execute:

	java -jar TestCHIP.jar


These jars are a bit inflated in size (partcilarlly the Test jar) because these classes use the TestHarness from DTRules to make the compile and the test processing easy.  With a little work, the test processing to eliminate all the jars needed for compilation, which would bring it down in size to around 500K.
